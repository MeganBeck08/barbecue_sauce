<p> Big Joe had been working as a server for fifty years before branching out on his own to start Big Joe's Barbecue Joint. Big Joe's Barbecue Joint was founded in 2015 in sunny Micanopy, Florida. Since then we have expanded into Jacksonville, Orlando, Miami, and Tampa and have been labeled as the best barbecue joint in the southeastern part of the country. </p>

<h2> Our Promise </h2>
<p> You may be wondering to yourself how a small town family restaurant has been able to grow and expand so much in such a short amount of time. The simple answer to that is, the people. The people that great you at the door, the people that work diligently to make sure you are getting the quality food you pay for and the people that work diligently to provide a fun environment. Here at Big Joe's we promise to provide a family friendly atmosphere and top-notch service to ensure an enjoyable experience for every member of your family.
