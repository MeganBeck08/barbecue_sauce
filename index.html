<p> Big Joe had been working as a server for fifty years before branching out on his own to start Big Joe's Barbecue Joint. Big Joe's Barbecue Joint was founded in 2015 in sunny Micanopy, Florida. Since then we have expanded into Jacksonville, Orlando, Miami, and Tampa and have been labeled as the best barbecue joint in the southeastern part of the country. </p>
